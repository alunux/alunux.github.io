                    <h2>I'm Endorsing Bernie Sanders for POTUS</h2>
                    <p>Bernie and I agree on things like:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Stopping domestic spying and ensuring the privacy of US Citizens.</li>
                        <li>Campaign finance reform and the abolition of gerrymandering to ensure fair elections.</li>
                        <li>Working to stop the looming threat of climate change, preserving the environment we depend on, and re-invigorating the US economy by focusing on a new clean energy infrastructure and stopping fracking and offshore drilling.</li>
                        <li>Securing health care and services for all US Citizens with a single payer healthcare system.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I strongly recommend that you visit iSideWith.com and take their political quiz before choosing a presidential candidate. iSideWith is non-partison and is designed to match you with a candidate based on what matters most: the issues.</p>

                <h2>Dan on Public Policy</h2>
                <p>I am not a lawyer, politician, scientist, economist, or civil engineer. I'm just a software developer. When I approach public policy issues, I do it from an engineering and design perspective. It's my belief that we can only solve our biggest problems by identifying and adressing their root causes. I've chosen to highlight some of the things below as what I believe to be big solutions for many of the problems we face in the US today.</p>

                <span class="inline-revealer" tabindex="0"><h3>Clean, Cheap, Domestic, Renewable Energy</h3></span>
                <div class="revealer">
                    <p>The price of energy affects the price of everything. When gas prices go up, so do bread prices. Entangling energy and foreign policy allows the US economy to be held hostage by outside interests. Domestic energy eliminates the need to pursue foreign conflicts in order to secure energy prices. </p>
                    <p>Energy production needs to be clean, not just for the air we breath but also for the water we drink. Recent disasters in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flint_water_crisis">Flint, Michigan</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliso_Canyon_gas_leak">Los Angeles, California</a> only serve to highlight that our current means of energy production are unsafe and cause tangible public harm in addition to contributing to adverse climate change.</p>
                    <p>A transition from fossil fuels is necessary to combat the largest global security issue of our time: climate change. The adverse effects of climate change have already <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/23/martin-omalley/fact-checking-link-between-climate-change-and-isis">lead to civil unrest</a> in the Middle East. If we do nothing by 2100, <a href="http://phys.org/news/2015-10-sea-swallow-miami-orleans.html">Over 1 Million</a> US citizens could be forced to relocate due to rising sea levels.</p>
                </div>

                <span class="inline-revealer" tabindex="0"><h3>Universal Basic Income</h3></span>
                <div class="revealer">
                    <p><a href="http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=UBI means a smaller government that provides a springboard for finding meaningful employment &hashtags=BasicIncome" class="inline-tweet">UBI means a smaller government that provides a springboard for finding meaningful employment.</a></p>
                    <p>Current state assistance programs that rely on means testing create a situation where finding work may result in a net loss of income. Not only that, but means testing implies overhead in these programs to determine eligibility. This means that people participating in these programs are disincentivized to find work and we pay extra to keep it that way.</p>
                    <p>Economists say that raising the minimum wage <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/nov/06/ben-cardin/does-raising-minimum-wage-result-job-growth/">is either harmful or has no effect</a>. UBI would allow us to abolish the minimum wage, creating a free-er market by lowering costs of production. </p>
                    <p>UBI disincentivizes wasteful government spending and inefficient union practices. Creating more "jobs" is no longer a concern; doing real meaningful work as efficiently as possible is.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU">Job automation is inevitable</a>, but more than that job automation is good for society. We should strive for a future where people are no longer forced to find work in order to survive. UBI allows for an economy where the elimination of jobs doesn't mean starvation and homelessness.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Criminal Justice Reform</h3>
                <p>The current criminal justice system unfairly penalizes the poor. Individuals with criminal records have a difficult time re-integrating.</p>
                <p>In an ideal society we don't just punish criminals, we seek to remove the conditions that lead to crime.</p>
                <p>It should be easier to do the right thing than to do the wrong thing. If it's easier to succeed by harming others, something is broken</p>
